### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2020

+ Projec title: A "Data Story" of Hip-Hop Music
+ This project is conducted by Zhiyuan Zhang

+ Project summary: Hip-Hop music is unqiue for its lyrics. In this project, I carried out an exploratory data analysis focusing on the lyrics of Hip-Hop music to explore the hidden information in Hip-Hop music. The approaches are mainly based on statistical methods, including text mining, word frequency analysis, sentiment analysis as well as topic modeling. From the analysis results, we can find that hip-hop music is full of informal and rude words. The emotions of hip-hop music are mainly negative. In the early years, hip-hop music was mainly about life and love, but recent years’ hip-hop music has increased the topics related to negative emotions. However, trust is the main emotion based on the sentimatal analyis. Although the form of hip-hop music is relatively vulgar, its core of Hip-Hop music is always peace and love.
